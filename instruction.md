This app lets you visualize OLS regression with one or two variables as well as an interaction. It should help teaching what regression, and controlling for covariates, does.

For example: Let's explore the relationship of political interest and reading newspapers.
* Regress political interest on whether a someone reads newspapers. You will see that reading newspapers predicts higher levels of political interest. 
* Now add education as a second independent variable. The predictive effect of reading newspapers diminishes. The 3D scatterplot and the regression hyperplane illustrate why: Those reading newspapers also tend to have higher levels of education. Thus, some of the difference between newspaper readers and non-readers can be explained by education. 
* Now select the "Interaction" box to check whether the predictive effect of readings newspapers differs across levels of education. The regression plane suggest suggests that reading a newspaper is more strongly related to political interest for those with lower education (but the interaction is small and statistically insignificant).

The data used is the British Election Study 2017 that can be found at https://www.britishelectionstudy.com/data-object/2017-face-to-face/. It has been reduced to include the following variables only: 
* age in years
* ideology: between 0 = left and 10 = right
* education_level: between 1 = "No qualifications" and 6 = "Postgraduate level"
* canvassed: whether or not respondent was canvassed during election campaign
* read_newspapers: whether or not respondent reads newspapers
* political_trust: between 0 = "no trust" and 10 = "great deal of trust"
* political_interest: between 1 = "Not at all interested" and 4 = "Very interested"
